[Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) is a great ~~swiss army knife~~ http client that does much more then just make it easy to work with HTTP, supporting a plethora of URI addressable protocols. Over the years, the curl command line interface has grown - exposing many options with most users only ever invoking a subset of features, learning more advanced features over time.

[Curlscript](https://github.com/xquery/curlscript) is a utility that exposes much of curl's goodness via a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) making it easy to build up
pipelines of execution using a 'little language' with built in primitives and natural bias for working with http.  

## Getting started

Download a release or build the software.

## Usage

To get help run

```$bash
> curlscript -h
```

```$bash
curlscript 0.1.0 | â“’ 2017-2018 James Fuller <jim.fuller@webcomposite.com> | https://github.com/xquery/curlscript

> curlscript mycurlscript.cs 
    -h | --help   : Help.
    -d | --debug  : Emit debug info logging.
    -i | --info   : Emit info logging.
    -l | --log    : Enable logging to file.
    -q | --quiet  : Suppress output to console.
    -a | --auth   : Pass a username:password pair as the argument.
    -A | --auth-type : Specify the auth mechanism (basic|digest).
    -p | --params : Define set of parameters for transclusion with file (json|xml).
    -P | --param  : Define parameter(s) for transclusion.    
```

Curlscript options for controlling how much information is emitted during processing.

| short  | long     | description   |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| -h     | --help   | Obtain help   | 
| -d     | --debug  | Emit debug info logging.|
| -i     | --info   | Emit info logging.|
| -l     | --log    | Enable logging to file.|
| -q     | --quiet  | Suppress output to console.|

### Authentication
These flags set the default auth credentials and auth-type to be used with all http calls.

| short  | long        | description   |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| -a     | --auth      |  Pass a username:password pair as the argument.  |  
| -A     | --auth-type |  Specify the auth mechanism (basic|digest). |

~/.netrc (on windows ~/_netrc) is also supported by curlscript: 
```$bash
> cat ~/.netrc
machine example.org
login myuser
password mypassword
```

### Parameters

| short  | long     | description   |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| -p     | --params | set file containing params (xml|json format).| 
| -P     | --param  | set a param (ex. -Pid=1).|


where data.json is
```$json
{"id":1, "name":"Ali G"}
```

```$bash
> curlscript -p data.json example.cs
```

or if xml floats your boat, then data.xml looks like 
```$xml
<params>
<param>
<name>id</name>
<value>1</value>
</param>
<param>
<name>name</name>
<value>Ali G</value>
</param>
</params>
```
and similarly called
```$bash
> curlscript -p data.xml example.cs
```

Paramaters can be individually passed (and override params if used in conjunction with -p flag).

```$bash
> curlscript -Pid=1 -Pname=Ali G example.cs
```

## The curlscript (little) language

Curlscript defines a series of statement(s). The simplest statement just defines retrieval of a URI:
```$bash
[http://www.httpbin.org/get] ;
```
where the seperator (;) is optional. In addition to a URI, you can construct literal, xml or json data.
```$bash
"literal data" ;
```
```$xml
<person><name>Tommy</name></person> ;
```
```$json
{id:1,name:"Tommy"};
```
A statement can then use an operator to perform actions on data.
```$bash
[/tmp/data.json] | [http://httpbin.org/post] 
```
```$bash
<person><name>Tommy</name></person> | [http://httpbin.org/post] 
```
```$bash
{id:1,name:"Tommy"} | [http://httpbin.org/post] 
```

Statements can be chained together using operators.

```$bash
[/tmp/data.json] | [http://httpbin.org/post] > [/tmp/output.txt]
```
where the allowable set of operators are:

| operator  | description   |
|-----------|---------------|
| &#124;    | used to POST, PUT or DELETE.| 
| &#62;     | redirect output to file.|
| &#62;&#62;| append output to file.|
| =&#124;   | used to force PUT or DELETE.|

Values can be passed into curlscript 
```$bash
> curlscript -Pname=Tommy example.cs 
```
and replace tokens (ex ${token}) in both data or URI itself.
```$bash
{id:1, name:"${name}"} | [http://httpbin.org/post]
```

```

force an HTTP PUT
```$bash
{"test:1} =| [http://www.httpbin.org/put]
```

##### DELETE
will deduce if endpoint supports DELETE
```$bash
[] | [http://www.httpbin.org/delete]
```

force an HTTP DELETE
```$bash
[/dev/null] =| [http://www.httpbin.org/delete] 
```

##### Transclusion in URI
```
${mypayload} | [http://www.httpbin.org/delete/${myid}]
```

##### Transclusion in payload
```
{"id":${myid}} | [http://www.httpbin.org/delete/${myid}]
```

##### Comparison
```$bash
[http://www.httpbin.org/get].url == 'http://www.httpbin.org/get'
```
```$bash
[http://www.httpbin.org/get] .url != 'http://www.example.com'
```

## Points of Interests

Curlscript is by design a 'little language' and most likely missing features from your 'favourite' language. It is intended as an adjunct to your existing script processing or host language. 

To provide a framework for design thoughts, here are a few possibly non obvious gaps in the current codebase.

* Curlscript is not intended as a drop in replacement for the curl tool (which is already a great [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)).
* Intentionally [lazy](http://threevirtues.com/) defining internals or worrying too much about performance at this stage.
* Curlscript language is defined with an [EBNF](etc/csparser.ebnf) which is used to produce a strict parser.
* Designing a programming language is hard - coherence and an easy to run AST are the first goals, please do [raise an issue](https://github.com/xquery/curlscript/issues) if you feel strongly where syntax could change.
* I find using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) non intuitive ... its enforced usage on this project is an attempt to learn more (otherwise you would see a Makefile here!). 
* Currently curlscript is http centric in initial releases.
* Woefully ignorant of windows platform ... looking at [appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) to eventually help solve that ([issue #2](https://github.com/xquery/curlscript/issues/2)).

I have blatantly stolen (and deformed) concepts from many places (bash, unix pipes, etc..). The following projects provide alternate approaches to solving similar problems that
curlscript is trying to address and worth a mention.

* [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) 
* [curlrc](https://github.com/benwebber/curlrc)

## Developing curlscript

Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/xquery/curlscript/issues) or make a contribution by forking the repository and creating a [pr](https://github.com/xquery/curlscript/pulls). 

### Compiling

To build software, run cmake:

```$bash
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_MANUAL=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF 
> make 
> make test
> make install
```

Running cmake requires access to the internet to pull down dependencies. This is problematic  approach for 
those wishing to build on a standalone machine off the network (tracked as [issue 1](https://github.com/xquery/curlscript/issues/1))

The build will complain if there are other common dependencies missing from your platform (ex. openssl).

### Testing

Tests require [httpbin](http://httpbin.org) - which should be setup on port 81 - running the following docker command
or however way you feel comfortable installing.

```$bash
> docker run -p 81:80 kennethreitz/httpbin
```

After building usually it is just a matter of running make test target.

```$bash
> make test
```

or you could run directly
```$bash
> cd test
> ./runAllTests
```

### Generating the Parser

lib/curlscript/csparser.cpp is generated using [REx Parser Generator](http://www.bottlecaps.de/rex/) with the 
following flags.

```$bash
-name csparser -tree -cpp -faster
```

### Release Package

Release packages are built using CPack.

Make a release build, ensuring you make a 'release' build and disable tests.
```$bash
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCURLSCRIPT_DISABLE_TESTS=true -DENABLE_MANUAL=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF 
> make
```
Then run cpack in cmake build directory
```
> cpack --config CPackConfig.cmake

````
